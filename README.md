# JazzBot

Jazzbot is a fairly simple discord bot using the discord.js library. This project was practice in writing and modifying code over a long period of time, including updating code as dependencies were updated. The project is also fully dockerized, including a companion mysql server, so that it can be run on any operating system, or on a server. Finally, this is the only code that I have that is written to function constantly, with minimal down time.
